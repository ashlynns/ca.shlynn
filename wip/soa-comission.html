  	<h3>First of all, wow welcome to my comissons page, thanks so much for being here. If you are seeing this it means I am currently accepting new proposals!</h3>

  	<a>  To submit a comission request please answer the following questions and send them off to me in an email! 

		First a general list regardless of the scenario then some specifics for each of the three categories these request generally fall into: 


		<ul>
		<li>How large of a piece would you like? </li>
		<li>What colour pallet do you gravitate towards?</li>
		<li>What are your floral preferences? </li>
		<li>What is your budget?</li>
	</ul>

		<b> Category 1: A recreation of one of my pieces: </b>
		<ul>
			<li> A photo/description of the piece you have in mind</li>
			<li> Are you hoping for any changes or an exact replica? </li>
		</ul>

		<b> Category 2: A very specific piece, you know exactly what you want: </b>
		<ul>
			<li> References! I love a pintrest board, especially if we can both contribute.</li>
			<li> What it is about your refrences you love so much? </li>
			<li> More references!</li>
		</ul>

		<b> Category 3: You're not really sure what you want but you know you want something: </b>
		<ul>
			<li> What kinds of shapes are you drawn towards (circles, squares, diamonds, etc) </li>
			<li> Do you prefer sharp geometric lines, defined curves, freehand squiggles, a combination, or something I missed? </li>
			<li> How large of a floral component, if any, would you like in ur piece? </li>
			<li> Are their any shapes or motifs you are really drawn towards? </li>
			<li> Really just any other info you can think of that would be a useful diving point for this project!</li>
		</ul>

		 I've done my best to answer any questions you might have regarding getting your hands on my work over on the FAQ page. If you've read through that and still dont have your answer shoot me a DM on instagram or an email.
